# SpringBootAPI

This is an example of a Spring Boot API that uses a PostgreSQL database. 

This API is a simple CRUD API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete Run data 
structure. 

There was used a Docker compose.yml file to simplify a DataBase creation in Development mode.

The API also uses REST Client Dependencies to reachout another service from public https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ website. 
It is a way to talk with another HTTP REST CLIENT.

In another branch called "testing" there is a simple Unit tests. Those tests are using 
"spring-boot-starter-test" dependency tools which are available in Spring Project from Start.
